# Day_01 - Description
# 🗓️ Day 01 – Arrays, Brute Force, Sorting

## ✅ Goals for Today

- Implement array operations using **only loops and conditions**
- Avoid all Python built-ins (e.g., `len()`, `sum()`, `max()`, `set()`)
- Practice problem-solving with full logic implementation
- Begin solving LeetCode problems related to arrays using brute force
- Learn and code manual sorting techniques: **Bubble Sort**, **Selection Sort**

---

## 📘 Topics Covered

### ➤ Core Concepts Practiced
- Array traversal (without `len()`)
- Insert at index
- Delete at index
- Search, frequency, sum, average
- Find min, max, 2nd min, 2nd max
- Left and right rotation
- Reverse an array (manual)
- Remove duplicates (manual)
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort

### ➤ LeetCode Problems (Brute Force Only)
- [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)
- [Maximum Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/)
- [Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/)
- [Merge Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/)
- [Contains Duplicate](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/)

## 🧠 Summary

> ✅ I focused on building **raw problem-solving logic** without relying on any shortcuts.  
> Learned to simulate `len()`, `sum()`, and even set-like behavior using just loops and manual conditions.  
> Sorting was implemented from scratch using nested loops.  
> I started applying this logic to real LeetCode problems using brute force only, to gain deep intuition.

## 📌 Example Manual Problems Solved
- Find max, min
- Second largest/smallest
- Sum & average (without `sum()` or `len()`)
- Left rotate, right rotate
- Remove all occurrences of an element
- Merge two arrays manually
- Count frequency of elements
- Check for duplicates without `set()`
- First repeating element
- Return array without slicing
- Target sum pair (basic 2-sum)

## 🔄 What's Next?

Tomorrow (Day 2), I’ll begin with:
- Hashing (manual and dict-based)
- Frequency counters
- LeetCode: Valid Anagram, Intersection of Arrays, Isomorphic Strings
- Two-pointer introduction
