# 📘 DSA_Daily – 30-Day Data Structures & Algorithms Challenge

This repository tracks my 30-day journey to master core DSA concepts using **manual Python logic first**, followed by optimized and LeetCode-based solutions.  
I'm doing this with the goal to build strong fundamentals for coding interviews, problem-solving, and peer learning.

---

## 🧠 What's Different?

- ⛔ No shortcuts: All problems are solved manually without built-ins (no `len()`, `set()`, `max()` initially)
- ✅ Every solution is logic-first, then optimized (leet code problems of the particular day might not be optimized on the intial day itself brute force is expected to be there in early days)
- 📚 Each day is focused on a core DSA topic
- 📌 LeetCode problems are included only when conceptually relevant

## 🗓️ Daily Structure

# 📌 DSA 30-Day Mastery Plan – Blockwise Breakdown

# 📌 DSA 30-Day Mastery Plan – Blockwise Breakdown (Revised)

This roadmap follows a structured block-wise strategy with:
- 6 Concept Blocks
- 1 Revision Block 
- Full revision days after each block
- 5–6 LeetCode problems daily (repeat + track for optimization)
- 10 logical problems(to just keep logic building)
- 10 problems on current concept of the day
